### Microservice Architecture

        What are microservices?
        Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

        Highly maintainable and testable
        Loosely coupled
        Independently deployable
        Organized around business capabilities
        Owned by a small team
        The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack
